# TIN100

The main file for the app is streamlit_app.py. It was made after we trained our ANN model in tin100-ann-model.pynb

The streamlit app incorporates our model which we have called tin100-ann-model.h5

You can test our app by using this link https://tusjmeister-tin100-streamlit-app-ddoem0.streamlit.app

If you want to run the app locally, you have to instead download streamlit_app.py and tin100-ann-model.h5, put them into the same folder
and run the app via the console command "streamlit run streamlit_app.py"
